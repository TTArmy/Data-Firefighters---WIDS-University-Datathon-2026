The Intersection of Fire and Society
Wildfires have become one of the most pressing environmental challenges in the United States, growing in both frequency and intensity due to shifting climatic patterns and changing land-use practices. While the ecological and atmospheric drivers of these fires are well-documented, the human dimension—specifically how social and economic structures dictate the impact of these events—remains a critical area of study. This project, titled "Wildfires and Social Vulnerability: A Territorial Analysis Across the United States," seeks to bridge the gap between environmental hazard and social reality.

The core objective of this research is to move beyond viewing wildfires as purely "natural" disasters. Instead, we analyze them as socio-environmental phenomena where the severity of the impact is determined not just by the heat of the flames, but by the resilience of the communities they strike. By analyzing data from 962 territorial units (counties), we investigate how variables such as income inequality, digital poverty, disability rates, and age-related isolation interact with fire dynamics to create pockets of heightened vulnerability.

Our analysis follows a rigorous three-step methodology. First, Descriptive Statistics provide a baseline of the stark disparities across US counties, highlighting the skewed distribution of fire impacts and economic resources. Second, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) utilizes correlation matrices and multi-dimensional visualizations to uncover hidden patterns, such as the link between "digital poverty" (lack of internet access) and increased fire exposure. Finally, we employ advanced Machine Learning techniques—specifically Ensemble methods like Random Forest and LightGBM—to model these complex relationships.

The modeling phase is particularly revealing. By utilizing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, we move beyond "black-box" predictions to achieve true model interpretability. Our findings consistently show that while the physical hazard (the number of fires) is the primary driver of burned area, socio-economic factors act as significant "force multipliers." Factors like median income, the Gini index of inequality, and lack of vehicle access significantly influence a community's exposure and its capacity for evacuation and recovery.

Ultimately, this project underscores a vital policy implication: managing wildfire risk is not just about firefighting and forest management. It is equally about addressing social inequities. Reducing the impact of wildfires requires a holistic approach that integrates emergency response with social welfare, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations—those with limited mobility, restricted access to information, or lower economic buffers—are not left behind when the smoke clears. Through this territorial lens, we provide a roadmap for more equitable and effective disaster risk management.
